# Problem: Chitti’s Self-Replication Challenge

Chitti, the super-intelligent robot, has learned the power of self-replication. But there’s a catch — the replication process follows a strange pattern!

Given an initial number of Chittis, the replication works like this:

- On **odd-numbered hours**, each Chitti replicates **`i` times** (where `i` is the current hour number).
- On **even-numbered hours**, exactly `i` Chittis are **added** to the total count.

Your job: After a given number of hours, determine how many Chittis are still active!

## Input:
- `initial_chittis` — Number of Chittis at hour 0
- `hours` — Total number of hours of replication

## Output:
- Total number of active Chittis after the given hours

## Example:

**Input:**
```python
initial_chittis = 5  
hours = 5  
```

**Output:**
```python
After 5 hours, the total number of Chittis is: 65  
```

**Explanation:**
1. Hour 1 (odd): `5 * 1 = 5` → Total: 5
2. Hour 2 (even): `5 + 2 = 7` → Total: 7
3. Hour 3 (odd): `7 * 3 = 21` → Total: 21
4. Hour 4 (even): `21 + 4 = 25` → Total: 25
5. Hour 5 (odd): `25 * 5 = 125` → Total: 125
